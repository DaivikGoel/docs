## Overview

The Shor API enables you to programmatically create payment links, manage transactions, and integrate payment functionality into your applications. Our RESTful API is designed to be simple, secure, and scalable.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.shorpay.com/api/v1
```

<Note>
Always use HTTPS for API requests. HTTP requests will be rejected.

## API Concepts

### Resources

The Shor API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON request bodies, returns JSON responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes.

**Main Resources:**
- **Payment Links**: Create and manage payment links
- **Transactions**: View and track payments
- **Merchants**: Manage merchant settings
- **Webhooks**: Configure event notifications

### Request Format

All POST and PUT requests must include:
- `Content-Type: application/json` header
- Valid JSON body
- Authentication header

Example request:
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.shorpay.com/api/v1/merchant/payment-links/create \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Premium Service",
    "amount": "100.00",
    "description": "One month of premium access"
  }'
```

### Response Format

All responses return JSON:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "link_abc123",
    "title": "Premium Service",
    "amount": "100.00",
    "url": "https://pay.shorpay.com/link/abc123"
  },
  "message": "Payment link created successfully"
}
```

## Rate Limits

To ensure API stability, we enforce rate limits:

| Plan | Requests per Hour | Burst Rate |
|------|------------------|------------|
| Standard | 1,000 | 100/minute |
| Pro | 10,000 | 1,000/minute |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom |

<Info>
Rate limit headers are included in all responses:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests per hour
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Requests remaining
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time when limit resets
</Info>

## API Versioning

The Shor API uses URL versioning. The current version is `v1`.

- Current: `https://api.shorpay.com/api/v1`
- Legacy versions will be supported for 12 months after deprecation
- Version changes will be announced 6 months in advance
