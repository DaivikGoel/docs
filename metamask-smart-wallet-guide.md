## What is Cryptocurrency and Why Do You Need a Wallet? {#what-is-cryptocurrency}

### Why You Need a Crypto Wallet

- **Transactions**: Send and receive cryptocurrency
- **Access to Web3**: Interact with decentralized applications (dApps)
- **Control**: You own your funds, not a bank

## Understanding Smart Accounts {#understanding-smart-accounts}

### What Are Smart Accounts?

Smart accounts are an upgraded version of regular crypto accounts that give you additional features without changing how you use your wallet. Think of it as upgrading from a basic phone to a smartphone - same core functionality, but with extra capabilities.

### Benefits of Smart Accounts:

1. **Batched Transactions**: Combine multiple steps into one (e.g., approve and swap tokens in a single transaction)
2. **Gas Flexibility**: Pay transaction fees in different tokens, not just ETH
3. **Better Success Rates**: 99.9% transaction success rate
4. **Enhanced Security**: Additional protection against common issues
5. **Future Features**: Automatically get new features as they're released

### Important Points:
- Your wallet address stays the same
- Your funds don't move
- You still control everything with your Secret Recovery Phrase
- You can switch back to a standard account anytime
