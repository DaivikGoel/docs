## What is a Smart Wallet?

### Traditional Wallets vs Smart Wallets

**Traditional Crypto Wallets (EOAs - Externally Owned Accounts):**
- Controlled by a single private key
- Limited functionality
- Manual transaction approval for every action
- No recovery options if you lose your private key
- Gas fees must be paid in ETH

**Smart Wallets (Smart Contract Accounts):**
- Programmable accounts with custom rules
- Advanced security features like multi-signature
- Social recovery options
- Batch transactions (multiple actions in one transaction)
- Gas payments in different tokens
- Automated transactions and subscriptions
- Session keys for seamless dapp interactions

### Why Smart Wallets Matter

Smart wallets bring crypto closer to traditional banking experiences while maintaining self-custody. They solve major pain points like:
- Private key management
- Account recovery
- Complex multi-step transactions
- High gas fees
- Poor user experience

## Understanding the Basics

### What You Need to Know Before Starting

#### Key Terms:
- **Private Key**: A secret code that controls your wallet (like a master password)
- **Seed Phrase**: 12-24 words that can restore your entire wallet
- **Gas Fees**: Transaction costs paid to the Ethereum network
- **EOA**: Regular wallet accounts controlled by private keys
- **Smart Contract**: Programs that run on the blockchain
- **DApp**: Decentralized application built on blockchain

#### Types of Networks:
- **Mainnet**: The main Ethereum network (real money)
- **Testnets**: Practice networks with fake ETH for testing
- **Layer 2s**: Faster, cheaper networks built on top of Ethereum

## Creating Your First Wallet

### Step 1: Initial Setup

3. Watch the security video (highly recommended)

**For Existing Users: "Import wallet"**

### Step 3: Secure Your Seed Phrase

This is the **MOST CRITICAL** step:

1. **Reveal Your Seed Phrase**:
   - Click "Reveal Secret Recovery Phrase"
   - Write down all 12 words in exact order
   - Double-check spelling and order

2. **Store Safely**:
   - Write on paper, never store digitally

## Upgrading to a Smart Account

### What are MetaMask Smart Accounts?

MetaMask now offers "smart accounts" that give your regular wallet superpowers while keeping the same address and security model. Your funds don't move, and you still control everything with your seed phrase.

### How to Enable Smart Account Features

#### Method 1: Automatic Upgrade (New Users)
If you're using MetaMask Extension v12.20+ or Mobile v7.52+, smart accounts are automatically enabled for new users.

#### Method 2: Manual Upgrade (Existing Users)

**From Settings:**
1. Open MetaMask
2. Click Settings (gear icon)
3. Navigate to "Accounts" section
4. Find "Smart accounts" settings
5. Toggle "Use smart account" to ON

**From Account Details:**
1. Click your account name dropdown
2. Select "Account details"
3. Look for "Switch to smart account" option
4. Click "Use smart account"

**During DApp Interaction:**
When using compatible dapps (like Uniswap), you'll be prompted:
"Switch to smart account for enhanced features?"
- Click "Use smart account" to upgrade
- Or "Don't use smart account" to decline

#### Method 3: Transaction-Triggered Upgrade
Smart accounts activate automatically when you use features that require them:
- Batch transactions
- Gas payments in other tokens
- Advanced permission systems

### What Happens During Upgrade?

1. **Small Gas Fee**: You'll pay a one-time setup fee
2. **Same Address**: Your wallet address stays identical
3. **Same Security**: Your seed phrase still controls everything
4. **Enhanced Features**: New capabilities become available

### Supported Networks

Smart accounts work on these networks:
- Ethereum Mainnet
- Optimism
- Base
- BNB Chain
- Gnosis Chain
- Arbitrum
- Polygon
- Various testnets (Sepolia, etc.)

## Smart Account Features

### 1. Batch Transactions

**What it is**: Combine multiple actions into one transaction.

**Example**: Instead of:
1. Approve token spending (Transaction 1)
2. Swap tokens (Transaction 2)
3. Pay gas twice

**With batching**:
- Approve + Swap in one transaction
- Pay gas once
- Faster execution

**How to use**:
- Visit compatible dapps like Uniswap
- Look for "batch transaction" options
- Confirm the combined action

### 2. Gas Payment Flexibility

**Pay gas with different tokens**:
- Use USDC, DAI, or other tokens instead of ETH
- More convenient when ETH balance is low
- Automatic conversion handled by the system

**Sponsored transactions**:
- Dapps can pay gas fees for you
- Enables truly "gasless" experiences
- Useful for onboarding new users

### 3. Session Keys

**What they are**: Temporary permissions for dapps to act on your behalf.

**Benefits**:
- No constant wallet popups during gaming
- Seamless dapp interactions
- You set spending limits and time restrictions

**Example use case**:
- Playing a blockchain game
- Allow game to make moves without constant approvals
- Set maximum spending limit (e.g., $10/day)

### 4. Social Recovery (Future Feature)

**Concept**: Recover your wallet through trusted friends/family instead of seed phrases.

**How it works**:
1. Select trusted "guardians" (friends, family, other devices)
2. If you lose access, guardians can help recover your account
3. Requires majority approval from guardians

### 5. Automatic Payments (Future Feature)

**Subscriptions**: Set up recurring payments like Netflix or utility bills.

**Scheduled transactions**: Automate regular transfers or DeFi strategies.
