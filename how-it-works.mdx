## Overview

Shor simplifies crypto payments by connecting traditional payment methods with blockchain technology. Here's how the entire system works from start to finish.

## The Payment Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Merchant Creates Payment Link">
    The merchant logs into the Shor dashboard and creates a payment link with:
    - Payment amount (or leave open for customer to specify)
    - Title and description
    - Product image (optional)
    - Enters their crypto wallet address
    - Fee handling preference

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Customer Receives Link">
    The merchant shares the payment link with their customer via:
    - Email
    - SMS
    - QR code
    - Direct link sharing
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Customer Makes Payment">
    The customer clicks the link and:
    - Enters their email
    - Selects payment method (e.g., Zelle, Venmo)
    - Completes payment through integrated providers
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Smart Contract Distribution">
    Once payment is confirmed:
    - USDC is sent to the merchant's smart contract
    - Funds are automatically distributed based on configured splits
    - Transaction is recorded on the blockchain
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Merchant Receives Funds">
    The merchant:
    - Receives USDC directly in their wallet
    - Can view transaction details in the dashboard
    - Gets notified via webhooks (if configured)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Components

### 1. Payment Links

## Fee Structure

Shor charges a small platform fee on each transaction. Merchants can choose to:

- **Absorb the fee**: Customer pays the exact amount, merchant receives amount minus fee
- **Pass fee to customer**: Coming soon - Customer will pay amount plus fee, merchant receives full amount

<Note>
Current fee structure and rates are available in your merchant dashboard settings.

- **Base**: An Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain offering low fees and fast transactions
