Cryptocurrency is digital money that isn't issued by a bank or government. Instead it uses cryptography to secure transactions on a public ledger called a **blockchain**. When people talk about holding crypto they're often referring to tokens such as **ETH** (Ether) or **USDC** (USD Coin) that live on the Ethereum blockchain.

- **ETH** is the native currency of Ethereum. It's used to pay transaction fees.
- **USDC** is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US Dollar. Each token is backed by dollar reserves so its price stays close to $1. Many people use USDC to hold value without the volatility of other crypto assets.

A crypto **wallet** lets you control addresses on the blockchain. MetaMask is one of the most popular wallets and works as a browser extension or mobile app.

Follow these steps to install MetaMask and create your first wallet.

## 1. Install MetaMask

1. Visit [https://metamask.io](https://metamask.io) and choose **Download**.
2. Select your browser or mobile platform.
3. Install the extension or app following the prompts.

## 2. Create your wallet

1. Open MetaMask and click **Get Started**.
2. Choose **Create a wallet**.
3. Set a strong password for accessing MetaMask on your device. This password does not replace your Secret Recovery Phrase.

## 3. Back up your Secret Recovery Phrase

MetaMask will display a 12-word Secret Recovery Phrase. **Write these words down and store them offline.** Anyone with this phrase can control your funds, so never share it.

After confirming the phrase, your wallet is ready.

## 4. Accessing and funding your wallet

Open MetaMask and enter your password to unlock the wallet. You can buy crypto on an exchange and send it to your wallet address. You might start with ETH or with stablecoins like USDC. When you receive USDC you are effectively holding digital dollars you can send to any Ethereum address.

## 5. Staying safe

- Keep your Secret Recovery Phrase private.
- Double-check addresses when sending funds.
- Beware of sites asking for your phrase or private key.
- Consider a hardware wallet if storing large amounts.

With MetaMask set up you can explore decentralized applications, trade tokens, or simply hold ETH and USDC securely.
