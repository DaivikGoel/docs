- **Minimum Fee**: $0.30 per transaction
- **No monthly fees**: Pay only for what you use
- **No setup fees**: Start accepting payments immediately

<Info>
Volume discounts available for high-volume merchants. Contact sales@shorpay.com for custom pricing.

### Additional Costs

Beyond platform fees:
- **Network Gas Fees**: Usually < $0.10 on Base
