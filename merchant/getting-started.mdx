## Understanding Your First Transaction

When a customer completes a payment:

1. **Notification**: You'll see the transaction appear in your dashboard immediately
2. **Settlement**: USDC is sent directly to your wallet (usually within minutes)
3. **Confirmation**: Transaction hash is available for blockchain verification
4. **Status Updates**: Track payment status from pending to completed

## How Payments Work

<Info>
When you create a payment link, Shor automatically deploys a smart contract on Base network. This contract receives customer payments and forwards them to your wallet address.
</Info>

### Payment Flow
1. Customer pays using Zelle(and soon Wise, Revolut, CashApp, Venmo)
2. Payment is converted to USDC
3. USDC is sent to your payment link's smart contract
4. Contract automatically forwards funds to your wallet (minus any fees)
5. You receive USDC directly in your wallet

### Important Notes
- You don't need to interact with smart contracts directly
- All transactions are transparent and verifiable on Base network
- Your wallet address cannot be changed after creating a link
