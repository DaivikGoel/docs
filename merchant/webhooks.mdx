description: "Automate your workflow with real-time event notifications"

## Overview

Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications when events occur in your Shor account. Instead of polling our API, you can register webhook endpoints to be notified instantly about payment events, link updates, and more.

## How Webhooks Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Endpoint">
    Set up an HTTPS endpoint on your server to receive webhook events
  </Step>
  <Step title="Register URL">
    Add your webhook URL in Shor dashboard settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive Events">
    Shor sends POST requests to your endpoint when events occur
  </Step>
  <Step title="Process & Respond">
    Your server processes the event and responds with 200 OK
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Available Events

### Currently Implemented

| Event | Description | When Triggered |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| `transaction.completed` | Payment successfully received | USDC confirmed in merchant's wallet |

<Info>
Additional webhook events are planned for future releases. Currently, only successful transaction notifications are sent.
</Info>

## Setting Up Webhooks

### 1. Create Your Endpoint

```javascript
// Express.js example
app.post('/webhooks/shor', express.raw({type: 'application/json'}), (req, res) => {
  const signature = req.headers['x-shor-signature'];
  const event = JSON.parse(req.body);
  
  // Validate webhook source (signature verification coming soon)
  // For now, ensure your endpoint URL is not publicly discoverable
  
  // Process event
  if (event.event === 'transaction.completed') {
    handleTransactionCompleted(event);
  }
  
  // Always respond with 200 OK
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```

### 2. Configure in Dashboard

1. Go to Settings → Webhook tab
2. Enter your webhook URL (HTTPS required)
3. Click "Save Webhook"
4. Use "Test Webhook" to verify your endpoint
5. View test results to debug any issues

### 3. Webhook Headers

Shor sends these headers with each webhook:

```
Content-Type: application/json
X-Shor-Event: transaction.completed
X-Shor-Timestamp: 2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z
X-Shor-Test: true  // Only present for test webhooks
```

<Note>
Webhook signature verification is planned for a future release. Currently, ensure your endpoint is not publicly discoverable and validate the payload structure.
</Note>

## Webhook Payload Structure

### Standard Format

All webhooks follow this structure:

```json
{
  "event": "transaction.completed",
  "orderId": "ORD-ABC123-XYZ789",
  "transactionHash": "0x123...abc",
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "merchantAmount": 97.10,
  "feeAmount": 2.90,
  "totalAmount": 100.00,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "paymentLinkId": "link_xyz789",
  "paymentLinkTitle": "Premium Service",
  "recipientEmail": "customer@example.com",
  "paymentMethod": "BANK_TRANSFER",
  "currency": "USD"
}
```

### Event Data Examples

### Example Webhook Payload

```json
{
  "event": "transaction.completed",
  "orderId": "ORD-1234-5678-9012",
  "transactionHash": "0xabc123def456...",
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "merchantAmount": 97.10,
  "feeAmount": 2.90,
  "totalAmount": 100.00,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:30:00.000Z",
  "paymentLinkId": "clqabc123xyz",
  "paymentLinkTitle": "Premium Consultation",
  "recipientEmail": "customer@example.com",
  "paymentMethod": "BANK_TRANSFER",
  "currency": "USD"
}
```

### Test Webhook Payload

When using the "Test Webhook" button, you'll receive:

```json
{
  "event": "transaction.completed",
  "orderId": "TEST-ORDER-123",
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "merchantAmount": 97.10,
  "feeAmount": 2.90,
  "totalAmount": 100.00,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:30:00.000Z",
  "paymentLinkTitle": "Test Payment",
  "recipientEmail": "test@example.com",
  "paymentMethod": "BANK_TRANSFER",
  "currency": "USD"
}
```

## Best Practices

### Endpoint Requirements

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="HTTPS Only" icon="lock">
    Webhooks only sent to secure HTTPS endpoints
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fast Response" icon="bolt">
    Respond within 5 seconds to avoid timeout
  </Card>
  <Card title="Idempotency" icon="copy">
    Handle duplicate events gracefully
  </Card>
  <Card title="Queue Processing" icon="layer-group">
    Process events asynchronously when possible
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Error Handling

Implement robust error handling:

```javascript
app.post('/webhooks/shor', async (req, res) => {
  // Immediately respond
  res.status(200).send('OK');
  
  // Process asynchronously
  try {
    await processWebhookEvent(req.body);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Webhook processing error:', error);
    // Log to error tracking service
    // Retry if necessary
  }
});
```

### Webhook Delivery

- **Timeout**: 10 seconds per request
- **Method**: POST with JSON payload
- **Response**: Your endpoint should return 200 OK

<Note>
Currently, webhooks are sent once with no automatic retry mechanism. Failed webhooks are logged but not retried. Retry functionality is planned for a future release.
</Note>

## Testing Webhooks

### Test Events

Send test events from dashboard:
1. Go to Webhooks settings
2. Click "Send Test Event"
3. Select event type
4. Click "Send"
5. Check your endpoint logs

### Local Development

Use ngrok for local testing:

```bash
# Install ngrok
npm install -g ngrok

# Expose local server
ngrok http 3000

# Use the HTTPS URL in Shor dashboard
# https://abc123.ngrok.io/webhooks/shor
```

## Common Use Cases

### Automated Fulfillment

```javascript
async function handlePaymentCompleted(data) {
  // Verify payment amount
  if (data.amount >= 100) {
    // Trigger digital delivery
    await sendDigitalProduct(data.customer_email);
    
    // Update inventory
    await updateInventory(data.payment_link_id);
    
    // Send confirmation email
    await sendConfirmationEmail(data);
  }
}
```

### CRM Integration

```javascript
async function syncWithCRM(data) {
  // Create/update customer record
  const customer = await crm.upsertCustomer({
    email: data.customer_email,
    last_purchase: data.timestamp,
    total_spent: data.amount
  });
  
  // Log transaction
  await crm.createTransaction({
    customer_id: customer.id,
    amount: data.amount,
    shor_transaction_id: data.transaction_id
  });
}
```

### Accounting Automation

```javascript
async function recordTransaction(data) {
  // Create invoice
  const invoice = await accounting.createInvoice({
    amount: data.amount,
    fee: data.fee,
    net: data.usdc_received,
    reference: data.transaction_id
  });
  
  // Mark as paid
  await accounting.markPaid(invoice.id, {
    payment_method: 'crypto_usdc',
    transaction_hash: data.transaction_hash
  });
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Webhook Security Checklist

✅ Security measures:
- [ ] Verify all webhook signatures
- [ ] Use HTTPS endpoints only
- [ ] Implement request timeouts
- [ ] Log all webhook events
- [ ] Monitor for unusual patterns
- [ ] Rotate webhook secrets periodically
- [ ] Validate event data structure
- [ ] Implement rate limiting

### Security Recommendations

<Info>
While webhook signatures are not yet implemented, you can:
- Use a hard-to-guess webhook URL
- Validate the payload structure
- Check that amounts match your records
- Verify transaction hashes on the blockchain
</Info>
