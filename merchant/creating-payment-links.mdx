## Optimizing Your Payment Links

### Effective Titles
<DOs>
- Be specific and clear
- Include key details (quantity, duration, etc.)
- Use action-oriented language
- Keep it concise (under 50 characters)
</DOs>

<DONTs>
- Use vague descriptions
- Include special characters that might break URLs
- Make it too long
- Use ALL CAPS
</DONTs>

### Compelling Descriptions
Write descriptions that:
1. Clearly explain what the customer is paying for
2. Include any important terms or conditions
3. Mention delivery or fulfillment details
4. Build trust with professional language

### Using Images
<Info>
Adding images can increase conversion rates by up to 40%. Use high-quality images that represent your product or service.
</Info>

Image best practices:
- **Format**: JPEG or PNG
- **Size**: At least 600x400 pixels
- **Content**: Clear, professional, relevant
- **Hosting**: Use reliable image hosting services

## Advanced Features

### Smart Contract Configuration
Each payment link automatically creates a smart contract on Base network that:
- Receives USDC payments from customers
- Deducts platform fees (if merchant absorbs)
- Sends remaining funds to your wallet address
- Provides transparent, verifiable transactions

## Payment Link Management

### Editing Links
You can edit:
- Title and description
- Amount (if not used yet)
- Image URL
- Active status

<Warning>
Once a payment link has been used, certain fields like amount cannot be changed to maintain transaction integrity.
</Warning>

### Disabling Links
Reasons to disable:
- Temporary stock shortage
- End of promotion
- Switching to new pricing
- Security concerns


## Wallet Address Requirements

<Warning>
**Critical**: Double-check your USDC wallet address before creating payment links. Payments sent to incorrect addresses cannot be recovered.
</Warning>

### Setting Your Wallet Address

When creating a payment link, you must provide:
- **Valid EVM wallet address**: 42 characters (0x + 40 hex characters)
- **Base chain compatible**: Must support USDC on Base network
- **Your own wallet**: You must control the private keys

### Wallet Address Format
```
Example: 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f2BD8e
         └─┘└────────────────────────────────────┘
         Prefix        40 hexadecimal characters
```

### Compatible Wallets
- MetaMask
- Coinbase Wallet
- Rainbow Wallet
- Any EVM-compatible wallet that supports Base network

<Note>
You don't need to connect your wallet to Shor. Simply copy and paste your wallet address from your wallet app.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Wrong wallet address**: Always copy-paste to avoid typos
2. **Non-Base compatible wallet**: Ensure your wallet supports Base network
3. **Unclear pricing**: Always be transparent about amounts
4. **Missing descriptions**: Provide context for payments
5. **Broken image links**: Test images before sharing
6. **Forgetting to activate**: Ensure links are active
7. **No testing**: Always test with a small amount first

<Tip>
Before your first real transaction, create a test payment link with a small amount ($1) to verify your wallet receives funds correctly on Base network.
