### Link Information Display

Each payment link card shows:
- **Title**: Link name
- **Amount**: Fixed amount or "Variable"
- **Status**: Active/Inactive indicator
- **Created**: Date of creation
- **Transactions**: Number of successful payments
- **Revenue**: Total collected through this link

## Organizing Your Links

### Naming Conventions

Develop a consistent naming system:

    Premium Course - Monthly
    Premium Course - Student Discount
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="By Date/Campaign">
    ```

    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Search and Filter

Find links quickly using:

</Info>

Common bulk operations:
1. **Bulk Activate/Deactivate**: For seasonal campaigns
2. **Bulk Export**: Download link details as CSV
3. **Bulk Delete**: Remove unused links (coming soon)

## Link Status Management

### Active vs Inactive

**Active Links**:
- Accept payments immediately
- Show green indicator
- Appear in customer searches
- Count toward your metrics

**Inactive Links**:
- Temporarily disabled
- Show gray indicator
- Return error if accessed
- Preserve all settings

### When to Deactivate

Consider deactivating links when:
- Product is out of stock
- Promotion has ended

## Editing Payment Links

### What You Can Edit

✅ **Always Editable**:

### Edit Best Practices

1. **Test First**: Create a test link before editing production links
