## Organizing Your Links

### Naming Conventions

Develop a consistent naming system:

## Link Status Management

### Active vs Inactive

**Active Links**:
- Accept payments immediately
- Show green indicator
- Appear in customer searches
- Count toward your metrics

**Inactive Links**:
- Temporarily disabled
- Show gray indicator
- Return error if accessed
- Preserve all settings

### When to Deactivate

Consider deactivating links when:
- Product is out of stock
- Promotion has ended
- Updating pricing
- Security concerns arise
- Testing new configurations

## Editing Payment Links

### What You Can Edit
