## How Wallet Addresses Work with Shor

With Shor, you don't need to connect a wallet like MetaMask directly to our platform. Instead, you simply provide your wallet address where you want to receive USDC payments. Here's what you need to know:

- **No wallet connection required** - Just enter your wallet address as text
- **You keep full control** - Payments go directly to your wallet
- **Base chain compatible** - Your wallet must support USDC on Base network
- **Any wallet works** - MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or any EVM-compatible wallet

## What is a Crypto Wallet?

A cryptocurrency wallet is a tool that allows you to:

- Store and manage your cryptocurrencies
- Send and receive crypto tokens like USDC
- Interact with blockchain networks
- Keep your funds secure with private keys

## Before You Begin

<Note>
**Security First**: 
- Never share your private keys or seed phrase with anyone
- Always double-check your wallet address before submitting it to Shor
- Ensure your wallet supports USDC on the Base network
- Incorrect addresses will result in permanent loss of funds
</Note>

## Getting Your Wallet Address

To receive payments through Shor, you need a wallet address. This is a 42-character string that starts with "0x" followed by 40 hexadecimal characters.

Example: `0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f2BD8e`

## Any EVM-Compatible Wallet Works

Shor supports **any wallet that works with Ethereum and Base network**, including:

- **MetaMask** - Most popular browser extension and mobile app
- **Coinbase Wallet** - User-friendly option from Coinbase
- **Rainbow Wallet** - Clean, modern interface
- **Trust Wallet** - Multi-chain mobile wallet
- **WalletConnect compatible wallets** - Hundreds of options
- **Hardware wallets** - Ledger, Trezor (with compatible software)

<Note>
**Already have a wallet?** Perfect! Just make sure it supports USDC on the Base network and you're ready to use Shor.

<Warning>
**Critical**: Always verify your wallet address is correct before creating a payment link. Payments sent to wrong addresses cannot be recovered.
