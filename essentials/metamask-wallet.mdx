## How Wallet Addresses Work with Shor

With Shor, you don't need to connect a wallet like MetaMask directly to our platform. Instead, you simply provide your wallet address where you want to receive USDC payments. Here's what you need to know:

- **No wallet connection required** - Just enter your wallet address as text
- **You keep full control** - Payments go directly to your wallet
- **Base chain compatible** - Your wallet must support USDC on Base network
- **Any wallet works** - MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or any EVM-compatible wallet

## What is a Crypto Wallet?

A cryptocurrency wallet is a tool that allows you to:

- Store and manage your cryptocurrencies
